GameObject
    Description:
        A GameObject represents an object in the scene. When one is instantiated, it is added to the scene. A GameObject will always have a transform, which stores information conserning the position, rotation, and scaling of itself. It will also have a list of components, which can alter the GameObject in different ways.
        When constructing a GameObject, it takes in 2 arguments. The first is mandatory, and is of type Vector2. This Vector2 tells the player the X and Y position of which they will be instantiated at. The second is optional, it's an array of components to be added to the GameObject. Each GameObject can not have more than 1 component of the same type.
    Constructor:
        new GameObject(Vector2)
            Constructs a GameObject with the position of argument1 and adds it to the scene.
        new GameObject(Vector2, ...)
            Returns a GameObject with the position of argument1 and components of all other arguments, and adds it to the scene.
    Properties:
        transform (Transform)
            Contains all info about the position, rotation, and scaling of the GameObject
        components (Array)
            List of all components in a GameObject
    Methods:
        addComponents()
            Will add all arguments to the GameObject as components.
        setComponents()
            Sets components in the GameObject to all arguments.
        getComponent(String)
            Returns component of GameObject with the type of argument 1. Error value is null
        getComponentID(String)
            Returns ID of selected component in component list with the type of argument 1. Error value is -1.

Component
    Description:
        Multiple components can be added to a GameObject to alter it's properties intially or in real-time. Each GameObject cannot have more than one of each component.
    Types:
        Transform
            Description:
                Contains all info about the position, rotation, and scaling of the GameObject. It exists outside of the component list and can be accessed by GameObject.transform
            Constructor:
                new Transform(Vector2)
                    Returns a Transform with the position of argument 1
            Properties:
                position (Vector2)
                    Vector2 that contains X and Y of the GameObject
                rotation (Number)
                    Value in degrees that the GameObject is rotated around the Z Axis
                scale (Vector2)
                    Vector2 that contains width and height of the GameObject
        Renderer
            Description:
                Contains information about how a GameObject should be rendered.
            Constructor:
                new Renderer(Array)
                    Creates a new Renderer using RGB solid colors. Argument 1 holds 3 values, one for R, G, and B.
                new Renderer(String)
                    Creates a new Renderer using an image. Argument 1 is the url for the image.
            Properties:
                data (Image OR String)
                    A property containing an Image Object or hex code depending on what kind of Renderer it is.
                dataType (String)
                    A string that contains "color" or "image" depending on what kind of Renderer it is.
                enabled (Boolean)
                    Default is true. GameObject will not render if enabled is false.
        Camera
            Description:
                Holds all necessary information that a GameObject needs to be a Camera. To change the camera that is rendering to the screen, use the setCamera() function.
            Constructor:
                new Camera(GameObject, tilesize)
                    Creates a Camera component drawing with a tilesize of argument 2. Argument 1 MUST BE the GameObject that contains this new component.
            Properties:
                tilesize (number)
                    Size of tiles that camera is drawing (in pixels)
                follow (GameObject)
                    Default is null. Camera will smoothly follow this GameObject, with a speed of followSpeed.
                followSpeed (number)
                    Default is 10. Camera will follow a GameObject with this speed. 1 is instantly following. The higher the number, the slower it follows
                enabled (Boolean)
                    Default is true. Camera will not run any executed methods if enabled is false.
            Methods:
                setFrameRate(Number)
                    Sets Frame Rate to argument 1. Default is 60.
